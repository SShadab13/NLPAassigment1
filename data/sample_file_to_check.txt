I went to the store this moring to buy some grocceries for the week. I needed to get appls, bannanas, and a few bottels of water. I also thoght about getting some cheese, but I didnt have enugh money. On my way back, I met with my frend Jane, and we decieded to go for a walk in the park. The wether was nice, but I forgot to bring my jaket and felt a bit cold. Still, it was a nice day and I was happy to see Jane again.
